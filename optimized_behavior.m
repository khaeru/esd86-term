  %    determines the rate of charge ('charge' > 0) or discharge ('charge' < 0) 
  %    of an energy storage system in order to minimize the cost of electricity,
  %    according to 'prices' for each period. The storage has a capacity of
  %    'cap', and can be charged at a rate up to 'c_in' (global variable) or
  %    'gen', whichever is smaller. It can be discharged at a rate of 'c_out'
  %    (global variable) or 'demand', whichever is smaller. OPTIMIZED_BEHAVIOR
  %    also returns the total amount of energy 'stored' in each period, and
  %    the 'savings' due to use of storage.
